<h1>Assignment 3: Our IT project</h1>
<body>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic</h4>
<div>
<h5>Big picture</h5>
<p>Game industry is a sector that encompasses the development, publishing, and distribution of video games. It is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow rapidly without any slight sign of slowing down because of its features of creativity and entertainment . In the perspective of Video game companies or Gaming device productors, As they find changes in their community, making a video game is no longer just basically a production of imagination. The resurgence of technological advancements and expansion of gaming platforms make the factor of following trends is also gradually becoming compulsory.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>Despite the adaptation being necessary, our team recognized that many companies had strategized that in the wrong way. A product should keep its core value as it is a precondition that makes the target customer come toward their game. With the purpose of enhancing the interest of customers about the game, and satisfying their curiosity.</p>

<p>WorldOfAristo.com is a website that exists as an encyclopedia which provides all informations about the game called The World of Aristio .This website displays not just a brief overview of the game including its genre, storyline, and key features, but it really brings them a whole world of fantasy in the most detailed way. Everything will be explained in a most clear way and this should give potential players a sense of what the game is about and what they can expect. For instance, a characterâ€™s introduction will not just have basic information such as: power, ethic..etc, but it would also include the relationships, conflicts between those characters, which make the stories more appealing and lively as people can understand and directly be involved in that story inside the game</p>

<h4>4.Scope and Limits</h4>
<p>In this project, we will create a website as an encyclopedia about games which provide users with all necessary information related to the games consisting of game developer, latest updated versions, genre, story, and key features. Furthermore, this website also has videos and screenshots to help users have the most intuitive look about the game and instruct them how to play it. Moreover, we desire to implement the community feature as an interactive environment for players for discuss, share their concerns about the game. Additionally, it also has the support center feature as a mean for players to look for help when having any issues during the playing process so that they can address their temporary problems immediately. These are all features for our website which will be evolved.
A wide range of tasks that have to be completed, while the time is limited. Therefore, we will only implement some main features as a prototype of this website based on our time available. These will comprise several key features at the basic level. The prototype will show users some basic information about the game such as the developer, its category, brief overview of the game, link to download, description of each character in the game as well as its own story so that people can have prior understanding about the concept we are intending to do when looking at our demo. Besides, for more sophisticated features in our project like the community and support center features may not be included because of limited time. If we would like to develop the community and support center, we will need to do a plenty of tasks including collecting data, creating the login feature for users, maximizing efficiency of the website and restricting breakdowns when having too many people access at the same time. Building a perfect website is a long process and it requires more expertise and experience. Therefore, for first-year students like us, these complicated features above are still limits of our project at the current time.</p>

<h4>5.Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>The project requires the use of specific software and other tools. Primarily, we need to use a text editor such as Notepad, PyCharm or VS Code for writing HTML web pages, CSS and JavaScript as well. In particular, HTML will be used for the aim of writing web pages, CSS for styling those pages. Additionally, programming languages such as Python, PHP or SQL will also be made use of for processing data, handling files in the back-end part. Moreover, we use Git to write commands for changes of files in the repository as well as an online tool like Github which will help us to store our project and collaborate with each other effectively. Besides, due to using Github for collaborating, we will work on our own laptop. Those are all necessary tools for us to embark on our project. Based on these tools, our group has had some experience in using HTML, CSS, Python as well as text editors such as VS Code, Notepad and PyCharm. Therefore, we can use them flexibly to accomplish our website as well as possible.</p>

<h4>9.Group processes and communications</h4>
<p>Communication is invariably the most important aspect in the teamwork environment to maintain the connection among team members and help the group achieve the final objective. To do that, we always try to increase the contact among members by different ways such as meetings, text messages. For meetings, we combine between face-to-face and online meetings through Google Meet. Due to the special situation of a member in our team, we have chosen the most convenient way to communicate so that our group can work easily and frequently. Normally, we have set up a meeting one times a week and each meeting often lasts for about one and a half hours to three hours. In these meetings, we discuss ideas to do group assignments and delegate specific tasks to each member in order that we can finish our work on deadline. In addition to holding weekly meetings together, we also set up a group chat on Messenger so that we can discuss extra information or issues related to our assignment during the working process more regularly. From our perspective, the maintenance of two means of communication simultaneously will help us to minimize the state of disconnection among members and also avoid affecting the common working progress of our group. This will be a significant key for our group to finish the assignments with good results.</p>
