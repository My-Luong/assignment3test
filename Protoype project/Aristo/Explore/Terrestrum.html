                <p>Description:</p>
                <p>Terestrium is a race existing on the planet Aristo. Although they do not possess any special abilities, it is precisely this lack of superiority that has compelled the Terestrium to develop their skills of observation and prediction in order to survive in a harsh environment. Over thousands of years of evolution, Terestrium has become one of the four strongest races on Aristo.
                </p> 
                    
                <p>Territory:</p>
                <p>Terestrium occupies a vast territory that stretches from the No Name coastline to the eastern part of the Pentagon mountain range. This is a significant and strategically important territory with diverse landscapes, including coastal areas, valleys, grasslands, and mountainous regions. Terestrium has cleverly utilized the geographical advantages to establish a powerful military system.</p>
                    
                <p>Ability:</p>
                <p>With significant advancements in technology, military capabilities, healthcare, and telecommunications, Terestrium has become a race with considerable military power on Aristo. They possess advanced technologies and effective military strategies, enabling them to access and gain advantages in invasions and attacks. The offensive actions of Terestrium often force other nations to be vigilant and sometimes concede to their threats.
