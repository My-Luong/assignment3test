                <h1>Humus</h1>
                <p>Description:</p>
                <p> Humus is a race that coexists with Terrestrium and shares the same origin and age. However, some primitive Humus migrated to the western region of Tartarus in search of what they consider to be a "sacred" place (a harsher region with a desert to the east). At the same time, a mysterious event occurred, causing the migrating individuals to be cursed with a lifespan of only 20,000 more years from that point.</p> 
                    
                <p>Politics:</p>
                <p>In terms of politics and military affairs, as users of alchemy, Humus has engaged in numerous conflicts with Terrestrium and Volant to control valuable resources. They are warlike but wise, and they do not sever ties with other races, considering trade as a necessary part of their development.</p>
                    
                <p>Ability:</p>
                <p>But they also inherited a special power, the ability to transmute and enhance different types of matter (alchemy-like magic, based on equivalent exchange), although not everyone is proficient in using it.</p>
