<h2>Team name: nerd123</h2>

<p>My name is Viet Hung (s4019303), I am a part of the team Nerds 123. When I was a kid I used to play around a lot with machines and technology, if I remember correctly none of my friends were interested in that. But later on in life, I realized that it was only human nature to want to understand something and be passionate about it. My passion for IT really started when I was introduced to the computer concept and networking. It was also a starting point in which my computer exploration hobby began. I have no particular helpful skill for working professionally for now but I hope to learn and gain many different skills.</p>

<p>My name is Duong Quoc Viet (SID: 3980685). I am currently studying at RMIT as a freshman in the major of Information technology and I am a member of the team “ The nerds 123”. The motivation which made me take Information Technology as my major since I first moved to university is my solid belief in the ability of technology within the process of realizing my ideas. I usually immerse myself in commercial entrepreneur TV shows like Shark Tank since I'm still a high school student and it just inspires me a lot about doing something special and then bringing it to the world. Highschool is also the time when I started having my first idea of business regarding technology and after that I immediately embarked on digging into the fascinating and complex world of syntax and algorithms. Through the learning process, I have picked up plenty of interesting knowledge and tried to apply it into practice. However, in order to become a professional app-developer in future, it is necessary for me to sharpen different sets of skills and widen my knowledge about this field.</p>

<p>My name Nguyen Viet Phap (SID: 4012986), I am a member of team nerds 123. These are some of my background. IT is my major. I am also a freshman student at RMIT. Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, participating in a variety of sports and learning programming. Coding and programming are things that I am always curious about . I find that information technology is very interesting and intriguing. Technology is a constantly growing field, it is involved in nearly every business, and IT jobs have a high earning potential. I love to study programs and how software works. Currently, my experience in this field is a little bit lacking so I am always looking forward to learning more about information technology.</p>

<p>My name is Luong Thi Tra My (s3987023), and I also belong to the team Nerds 123. Currently, I am a first-year student at RMIT University Vietnam with a major in Information Technology. I chose this major because of some reason. First of all, I would like to explore and learn more about modern technologies, especially those which can have the capabilities to support me in my life including learning and living such as The latest versions of screen readers, applications on smartphones, or even smart glasses – a product of AI that can assist visually impaired people to move independently by warning signals about barriers for users to help them be safe when moving. I have had a profound comprehension about the significant roles of technologies and accessible tools with visual impairments, since I studied in high school. Therefore, I have attempted to discover more about the process of making applications or software as well as their effects on human life consisting of their benefits and drawbacks in order that I could have a deeper insight into their features and also know the use appropriately. Nevertheless, it will be a long journey to stand out in the IT field. In order to help my peers the best, I need to equip myself with a variety of knowledge and skills. The fact that my current experience is like programming, installing crucial software is not enough. It is only sufficient for me to satisfy my needs. As a result, I decided to study for a Bachelor’s degree of Information Technology at RMIT University Vietnam with the desire of being provided specialized knowledge and skills in this area. Finally, I strongly believe that my impassion and perseverance will help me to overcome all challenges and difficulties in this major as well as fulfill my objective.</p>
